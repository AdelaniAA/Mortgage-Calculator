A mortgage calculator implemented using Java.

The program prompts for 3 inputs:

    - Principal Amount (Down Payment)($1k - $1M),
    - Annual Interest Rate (1 - 30),
    - Years expected to complete mortgage payment (1 - 30).
It then outputs the mortgage to be paid monthly.

PROGRAM UPDATE:
Payment schedule function that shows remaining balance after each payment for the duration of payments left till it reaches $0.
